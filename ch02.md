# Chapter 2
### Built-in Types
##### Arithmetic types
- Categories
    - integral types
        - `char` 
        - `bool` : non-zero = `true`
        - may be `signed` or `unsigned`
    - floating-point types
- Size of arithmetic types varies across machines.
- Don't mix `signed` and `unsigned` types -> unexpected behavior
- Literal
    - value is self-evident
    - every literal has a type
    - `-` is technically not a part of literal (operator)
    - `String literal`
        - array of `char` with null character(`\0`) at the end 
    - Can override default type of literal by supplying suffix or prefix
        - `L'a'` : wide character literal (`wchar_t`)
        - `3.14159L` : `long double`
##### Variables
- `type specifier` followed by name
- Initialization is not assingment
    - initialization: variable is given a value when it is created
    - assignment: obliterates current value of an object and replaces that value with a new one
- when initialized without value: __default initialized__
    - default value depends on the type of variablle and where it is defined.
    - outside function body : 0
- declaration vs definition
    - declaration: makes name known to the program
    - definition: create the associated entry
##### scope
- delimited by curly braces
- ```int i = 100, sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
            sum += i;
        std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl;

    // 100 45 
### Compound types
- References and Pointers
##### Reference
- alternative name for an object (refers to)
    - `&d`, where  `d` is the name being declared
    - is not an object, but just another name for an already existing object
    - all operations on reference are actually operations on the object to which the reference is bound
    - __cannot__ be declared without being initialized: 
        - `int &refVal;`
    - __cannot__ define a reference to a reference: 
        - `int &refVal3 = refVal;`
    - __cannot__ initialize to a literal: 
        - `int &refVal4 = 10;`
    - __cannot__ initialize to a different object
        - `double dval = 3.14; `
        - `int &refVal5 = dval;`
    - __cannot__ rebind to a different object
##### Pointer
- compound type that points to another type (holds ___address___)
- indirect access to other objects, object in its own right.
- __can__ be assigned and copied
- __can__ be defined without initialization
- __can__ point to different objects over its lifetime
- declaration: `*d` where `d` is the name being defined.
    - `int *ip1, *ip2;` note that `*` must be repeated for each pointer variable. 
    - `double dp1, *dp2;` `dp1` is `double`. `dp2` is pointer to `double`.
- `int *p = &ival;` use `&` operator to get the address(address-of operator)
- __cannot__ define pointer to a reference (reference is not an object, does not have address)
- value within pointer can take one of four states
    1. point to an object
    2. point to the location just immediately past the end of an object
    3. null pointer (not bound to any object)
    4. invalid
- for pointer to access object, pointer should be dereferenced
    - `int ival = 42; int *p = &ival; cout << *p; *p = 12; cout << *p;`
    - would print `42 12` (can assign new value to the object it is pointing to)
    - only valid pointer that points to an object can be dereferenced
- `null pointer`
    - does not point to any object
        - `int *p1 = nullptr;`
        - `int *p2 = 0;`
        - `int *p3 = NULL; // must #include cstdlib`
- `void* pointer`
    - can hold any type
    - assign to another void
    - cannot operate on object it addresses (type of object is unknown, so which operations can be performed is unknown)

### Pointer and References
|to|pointer | reference
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|__pointer__|stack `*`| illegal|
|__reference__|`int *p; int *&r = p;`|illegal|

```
int i = 42;
int *p;
int *&r = p; // r is a refernce to the pointer p
r = &i; // r refers to a pointer, assigning &i to r makes p point to i
*r = 0; // dereferencing r yields i, the object to which p points / i is now 0
```
